# GameOfFifteen
Command Line Game implemented in C

## Info
This was an exercise for Harvard's CS50 class' problem set. The code implements a command line game with the dimension specified by the
user.
Some skeleton code had already been provided, leaving the rest to be implemented on our own.
This repository contains the source C file along with the compiled executable. 
The executable is for linux, so to run on windows you'd have to recompile the c file.

## Credits
Credit must be given to the original CS50 team that took the time to make these problems sets and then publish them online for free. 
They also wrote some of the skeleton code to help me get started.
